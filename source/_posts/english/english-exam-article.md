Just 28 years ago , Berlin was a city divided into two by the Berlin Wall . How excited people were as the Berlin Wall came down . Since then , Berlin has become one of the colest citiest cities in Europe . Here are the main reasons why I think Berlin is coll.

First , Berlin has cheap hotel and everyday objects . You needn't worry about spending too much money when visiting Berlin.

Second , Berlin knows how to give parties , and there is a festival here every month ofthe year . Perhaps the most famous is the Berlin International Film Festival ( the BIFF ) .

Third , Berlin has beautiful buildings of its own . The Brandenburg Gate is one of thecity's most famous buildings . It's the symbol of more than 200 years of history . The TV Tower is as good as the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the London Eye .

Lastly , Berlin is a city of living art . Artist can create works of art on the sides of buildings.

If you want to visit a European city with culture , cheap objects and lots of colours , Berlin is the place to be . What are you waiting for ? Get to Europe's coolest city before anyone else discovers it .

Every year on my birthday since I was 11 , a white gardenia was sent to my house . No card ever came with it . Calls to the flower shop were not helpful at all . After some time I stopped trying to find out the sender’s name and was just pleased with the beautiful white flower , in soft pink paper . 

I couldn’t stop imagining who the giver might be . Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender . My mother encouraged these daydreams . She'd ask me if I had been especially kind to someone . Perhaps it was one of my classmates . Perhaps it was the old man . He lived across from the street . I’d sent him his mail during the winter . As a girl , I had more fun imagining that it might be a boy that I had met. 

A month before my high school graduation , my father died . I was so sad that I became uninterested in my upcoming graduation dance , and I didn’t care whether I had a new dress or not . My mother , in her won sadness , however , would not let me miss any of those things . She wanted her children to feel loved . In fact , my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia: lovely , strong and perfect , with perhaps a bit of mystery . 

When I was 22 , I got married. My mother died ten years after I was married . That was the year the gardenia stopped coming.

Lots of students know what a marathon is , but perhaps they don’t know what a triathlon is .The triathlon is a sport that has three parts — swimming , bicycling and running . It is not an easy sport , but a man named Joe Salter is very good at it.A few months ago,he finished a special triathlon — he juggled three balls all the time during the triathlon.That is to say  , he kept on throwing and catching three balls while he was swimming , riding a bicycle and running. 

31-year-old Joe is from Florida , the USA.He loves juggling and he started at the age of 8.Joe did well in juggling.Later , he got the idea to do a triathlon and juggle at the same time to make it more fun.Many juggling fans laughed at his idea and thought it was just a joke.But Joe didn’t give up and he kept practising it.Because of his hard work , he made it at last. 

Talking about his triathlon , Joe said swimming was the hardest part ." It was difficult and complex ," he said ." I basically only used my legs , so it took quite a lot of work . Also , swimming in open water made it a little harder.It was not like in a pool.

If you travel by air across the centre of Africa or south. America, you fly over forests for thousands of kilometres. These great forests are the oceans of trees. There are full of thousands and thousands of different kinds of plants and animals.

However, the worlds forests are getting smaller all the time. We are cutting down the trees because we need wood, and we need more farm land. Some people say that there will not be any forests like these in 20 or 30 years. What will happen if they disappear?

If we cut down our forests, a lot of plants and animals will disappear from the world. In a lot of places the new farm land will soon look like the old deserts. Crops will not grow there. It will not rain very often, and the weather will get very hot. Perhaps the climate of the world will change. This will be dangerous for everyone in the world. That is why we must take care of our forests.
